## Purpose:
 The purpose of this repo is to put together and share every useful bit of information that I find as I continue growing in my carreer. As of writing this file my goal is mainly to be the sole contributor of this project, but feel free to make any contributions you see fit.
 
 
## Content:
This project will focus mostly on frontend web technologies, but it may include topics like, mobile or app development, web optimization, design patterns, software architecture, technical writing tips, among other stuff.
